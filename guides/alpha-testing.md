# Alpha Testing

The Alpha Testing phase will be performed on Harmony Testnet and will be limited to a very small group (between 20-30 accounts). Users that participate in the Alpha Testing will receive free, lifetime subscriptions on the Mainnet release.

Although the subscription tokens will be tracked on the Testnet, foliio uses read-only web3 clients. This allows us to make queries to any network and for any account. In fact you can use a separate wallet solely for holding your subscription and then track your other accounts using foliio.&#x20;

### How to participate?

1. Follow the [instructions ](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/wallets/browser-extensions-wallets/metamask-wallet)to configure Metamask to Harmony's Testnet.
