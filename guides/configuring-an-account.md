# Configuring an account

Foliio allows you to track multiple wallets with a single subscription.&#x20;

In the foliio home page, click 'Accounts' in the side menu.

![Configure Panel](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

Click Auto-Scan to start searching for positions or 'BACK' to return to the Configure Panel

Once the scan is complete click "Next" to review the positions

In the review panel, you can choose to hide 'Dust'.  Foliio considers dust to be any position that is worth less than $0.01.  If everything looks alright, scroll to the bottom and click 'Save'

Your positions will now appear in the Dashboard
