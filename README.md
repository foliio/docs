# Introduction

### What is foliio?

Foliio is a cross-chain portfolio monitoring platform that aggregates wallet balances and liquidity provisions into a unified dashboard. It allows users to monitor their digital assets in a central location without sacrificing anonymity.

### SaaS + DApp

Foliio is designed to function as a SaaS (software as a service) but is also a DApp (decentralized application). As it grows we will be adding a variety of free content as well as subscriber-only content to the platform. The initial release is primarily focused on portfolio management on Harmony Mainnet which will be a free feature.&#x20;

### Wallet-based Authentication

Rather than using login credentials to authenticate, users connect to the application using their wallet. Authentication is determined by checking if the connected account is an owner of a subscription token that has not expired. A single subscription allows you to track any number of wallets.&#x20;

Subscription tokens can be purchased through the foliio website or by interacting with the FoliioSubscriptionManager contract directly.
