# Rollout

#### Alpha + Beta Testing

Prior to the Public Release, we will hold an Alpha testing phase and a Beta testing phase. During each phase, there will be a limited number of Alpha and Beta subscription tokens that users can mint. Accounts that claim a respective token will be granted access to the platform and discord.&#x20;

It is asked that users participating in the early access provide suggestions, feedback, and submit bugs that they encounter.&#x20;

Alpha and Beta testing will occur on Harmony Testnet. During this phase, accounts will require either subscription to access Foliio.&#x20;

#### Public Launch&#x20;

Upon Public launch, any Alpha/Beta subscription token balances will be migrated to Harmony Mainnet and will grant lifetime subscriptions to the initial subscription holders.&#x20;

The subscription-based limitation will be removed from the website and Foliio will become open to the public.&#x20;
